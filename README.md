# Blockchain-Based Donation System  

This project implements a **Blockchain-Based Donation System** that ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof donation processes. Built using blockchain technology, the system aims to address trust issues in the donation ecosystem by providing verifiable and decentralized record-keeping.  

## Features  

- **Secure Transactions**: Utilizes blockchain for encrypted and immutable transaction records.  
- **Transparency**: All donations are verifiable on the blockchain ledger.  
- **Decentralized**: Eliminates the need for intermediaries by leveraging a distributed system.  
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined process for sending and receiving donations.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or other framework, if applicable)  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Solidity for smart contracts)  
- **Database**: MongoDB (or other database, if used for off-chain storage)
